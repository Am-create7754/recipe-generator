The Recipe Recommendation System is a simple C++ program that suggests recipes based on the user's dietary preferences, 
available ingredients, and desired meal type. It helps users quickly find a suitable recipe without searching manually.

Features:
- Users can input their dietary preference (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).
- Users specify available ingredients.
- Users select the desired meal type (breakfast, lunch, or dinner).
- The program suggests a recipe that matches all criteria.
- If no exact match is found, a message is displayed.

How It Works:
1. The program prompts the user to enter:
   - Dietary preference
   - Available ingredients
   - Meal type
2. A predefined set of recipes is loaded.
3. The program checks which recipe meets the criteria.
4. If a match is found, it displays the recipe details.
5. If no match is found, it informs the user.

Prerequisites:
- A C++ compiler (such as g++ for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows).

Installation & Usage:
1. Copy the C++ code into a file, e.g., `recipe_recommender.cpp`.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   g++ recipe_recommender.cpp -o recipe_recommender
   
3. Run the executable:  
   ./recipe_recommender

4. Follow the prompts to enter your preferences and receive a recipe suggestion.

Example Usage
User Input:
Enter dietary preference (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free): vegetarian
Enter number of available ingredients: 3
Enter available ingredients: pasta tomatoes cheese
Enter meal type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner): dinner

Output:
Recipe Name: Vegetarian Pasta
Ingredients: pasta tomatoes cheese
Dietary Preference: vegetarian
Meal Type: dinner


Future Enhancements
- Expand the recipe database for more options.
- Allow partial ingredient matching for better flexibility.
- Implement a user-friendly graphical interface.
